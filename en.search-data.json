Diago try to offer more modern Stack and put you closer to protcol,network,media but offering High level and low level API calls.\nDiago is built with GO language and we are keeping well optimized sip and media stack to have performance and low GC latency. Major win is Go offers fast development speed and memory safety, but also tooling to tweak best performance.\nIn case you wondering is Go right language, there are already good benchmark results with just sipgo."},"title":"_index"},"/diago/docs/api_docs/":{"data":{"":"Library API tries to be well documented through comments.

SIP is textual protocol same as HTTP so if you know HTTP reading SIP messages will be easy. It acts similar and has similar behavior (request/response) but focus is more on Session. With realtime media like audio/video there is always session after which it ends. Creating, Updating, Clossing this Session is something that SIP is designed\nTo understand and have good debug skills it is important to know how SIP works in different situations.

More about this later\nAccepting(Answering) call is done by respondin with 200 OK\nResponse carries SDP in body as answer to explain callee’s media capabilites and connection.\nCall with media Here we will just explain most important things for media.\nWith SDP we explain our capabilites and protocol used for media and this mostly boils down to this 3 things:\nexplaining which codecs are supported for decoding (alaw,ulaw, opus, g722, …), protocol (RTP) and Listen IP where we expect incoming media (UDP) Client (Caller) and Server (Callee) both exchange SDP to explain their capabilites and Listening IP\nCodecs Codecs or in other words Formats are identified as numbers for audio.

It must contain same headers as INVITE for matching transcaction.\nCANCEL is new transaction request like INVITE which receives response, but SIP uses this request to try match existing INVITE transaction. That is why 200 OK is replied\nOnce Bob finds matching transcation it terminates and sends respond to INVITE with 487 Request terminated\nTO BE CONTINUED"},"title":"Understading SIP with Call Scenarios"}}
